RTeeL (R-Tee-L)
===============

RTeeL (R-Tee-L) converts RTL connected text to a form that could be rendered properly on systems that doesn't support RTL and connected letters.

It currently supports Arabic. 
Please contact me if you are interested in adding other languages (like Parsian), even without any programming skills.
